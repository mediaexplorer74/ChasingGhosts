## ChasingGhosts v1.0.1 ("the-sad-robot-shoe-chase" codename; pre-pre-alpha)


This is my fork of the desktop monogame "the-sad-robot-shoe-chase" demo project:
https://falgantil.itch.io/the-sad-robot-shoe-chase

My main goal is: explore ninject + Sharp2D game mechanics & adapt it for W10M (Astoria support planned too) ;)

## My 2 cents (status)
- Fast R.E.... 
- Project tuned on(to) "firm" Monigame.Framwork 3.8.xx...
- Some project research and minimal "re-dev"...
- W10(M) UWP template not ready ready... ("Game components" is hardcore!)

Here's a list of things to know before you play the game:

This is a submission for a 1-week gamejam, expect the gameplay to reflect as such.
